# Titanic
**Description:** *Titanic* is a playground Kaggle competition. It requires building a binary classifier to predict who survived the infamous Titanic disaster.

**Goal:**
- Practice in feature processing and feature engineering
- Test most popular ML classification and model selection algorithms
- Summarize the findings in plots and table (data distributions, dependencies, classification statistics)
- Create a single framework for the tasks above
- Submit a prediction on Kaggle
- Analyze the work, read Titanic public kernels and improve the framework

**Available features:**
- Name
- Age
- Sex
- Ticket price
- Ticket class
- Ticket number
- Number of family members aboard
- Port of embankment
